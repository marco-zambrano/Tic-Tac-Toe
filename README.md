# 🎯 Tic-Tac-Toe with React and Vite

This is a classic **Tic-Tac-Toe** game built using **React** and **Vite**.  
It includes features like **LocalStorage** to save game state and a simple yet efficient UI.

## Development Process 🛠️

1. **Vite and React Setup**:  
   I used **Vite** as the build tool to quickly set up the React project. The initial setup was done with the following commands:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/marco-zambrano/Tic-Tac-Toe.git
   cd Tic-Tac-Toe
   npm install
   npm run dev
